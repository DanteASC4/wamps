# wamps

wamps = what are my package scripts

A small tool to view package.json scripts easily from command line. Will eventually be tiny once I get around to writing my own version of the table module.

## Installation

```shell
# Yarn
yarn global add wamps

# NPM
npm i -g wamps

# pnpm
pnpm i -g wamps
```

## Usage

While in the same directory as a package.json file, run `wamps`
